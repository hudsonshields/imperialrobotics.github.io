Synopsis: We went to the kickoff of the season and watched the reveal of this season’s challenge. We then met at Virani’s house as our first meetup for new members.

Report: 
This was the moment we were all waiting for. 10:59 AM and 57 seconds, 58, 59. Finally. The reveal of the 2018 FTC Season Challenge...
 Today, we went to the Rover Ruckus Kickoff at Williams High school. Big shout out and thanks to Williams High school for having us! This year’s challenge consists of many yet complex tasks, including, the main task of depositing gold ores (blocks) and silver ores (balls) into the lander, setting the team marker in the team box, and re-harnessing onto the lander. 
We noticed that there were  several changes to the overall competition this year, including, the elimination of super-regionals, which means teams would directly advance from regionals to Worlds. 
During the reveal, we also had members take pictures of the game field and take measurements. After we got all the info we needed including the game manual, we immediately started brainstorming as a team, even in the midst of a crowded room. 

Reflection and Next Steps: 

We will meet at Mr. Virani’s (our mentor) house at around 1:00  pm to brainstorm ideas for an effective mechanism.
